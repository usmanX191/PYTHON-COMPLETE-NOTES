MySQL Database
To be able to experiment with the code examples in this tutorial, you should have MySQL installed on your computer.

Install MySQL Driver
Python needs a MySQL driver to access the MySQL database.

In this tutorial we will use the driver "MySQL Connector".

We recommend that you use PIP to install "MySQL Connector".

PIP is most likely already installed in your Python environment.

Navigate your command line to the location of PIP, and type the following:

python -m pip install mysql-connector-python

'''
#Now you have downloaded and installed a MySQL driver!
