#Each word, except the first, starts with a capital letter:
myVariableName = "Camel Case"

#Each word starts with a capital letter:
MyVariableName = "Pascal Case"

#Each word is separated by an underscore character:
my_variable_name = "Snake Case"

print(my_variable_name , ',' , MyVariableName ,'and' , myVariableName)
