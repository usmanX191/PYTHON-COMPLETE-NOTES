#String Methods
'''Python has a set of built-in methods that you can use on strings.'''
#Note: All string methods returns new values. They do not change the original string.

#Upper case the first letter in this sentence:
Capitalize = "hello, and welcome to my world."

x = Capitalize.capitalize()

print (x)

#Make the string lower case:
Casefold = "Hello, And Welcome To My World!"

x = Casefold.casefold()

print(x)

#Return the number of times the value "apple" appears in the string:
Count = "Pedro,Pedro,Pedro,Pedro,Pedro,Pedro,Pedro,Pedro,Pedro,Pedro,Pedro,Pedro,Pedro,Pedro,Pedro."

x = Count.count("Pedro")

print(x)

#Print the word "banana", taking up the space of 20 characters, with "banana" in the middle:
Center = "banana"

x = Center.center(20)

print(x)

#UTF-8 encode the string:
Encode = "My name is St√•le"

x = Encode.encode()

print(x)

#Check if the string ends with a punctuation sign (.):
EndsWith = "Hello, welcome to my world!"

x = EndsWith.endswith(".")

print(x)

#Set the tab size to 2 whitespaces:
WhiteTabs = "H\te\tl\tl\to"

x =  WhiteTabs.expandtabs(2)

print(x)

#Where in the text is the word "welcome"?:
Finder = "Hello, welcome to my world."

x = Finder.find("welcome")

print(x)

#Insert the price inside the placeholder, the price should be in fixed point, two-decimal format:
txt = "For only {price:.2f} dollars!"
print(txt.format(price = 49))

#Where in the text is the word "welcome"?:
txt = "Hello, welcome to my world."

x = txt.index("welcome")

print(x)

#Check if all the characters in the text are alphanumeric:
txt = "Company12"

x = txt.isalnum()

print(x)

#Check if all the characters in the text are letters:
txt = "CompanyX"

x = txt.isalpha()

print(x)

#Check if all the characters in the unicode object are decimals:
txt = "\u0033" #unicode for 3

x = txt.isdecimal()

print(x)

#Check if all the characters in the text are digits:
txt = "One"

x = txt.isdigit()

print(x)

#Check if the string is a valid identifier:
txt = "2bring"

x = txt.isidentifier()

print(x)

#Check if all the characters in the text are in lower case:
txt = "Hello World!"

x = txt.islower()

print(x)

#Check if all the characters in the text are numeric:
txt = "565543"

x = txt.isnumeric()

print(x)

#Check if all the characters in the text are printable:
txt = "Hello! Are you #1?"

x = txt.isprintable()

print(x)

#Check if all the characters in the text are whitespaces:
txt = "   "

x = txt.isspace()

print(x)

#Check if each word start with an upper case letter:
txt = "Hello, and welcome to my world!"

x = txt.istitle()

print(x)

#Check if all the characters in the text are in upper case:
txt = "THIS IS NOW!"

x = txt.isupper()

print(x)

#Join all items in a tuple into a string, using a hash character as separator:
myTuple = ("John", "Peter", "Vicky")

mySeparator = " and "

x = mySeparator.join(myTuple)

print(x)

#Return a 20 characters long, left justified version of the word "banana":
txt = "banana"

x = txt.ljust(20)

print(x, "is my favorite fruit.")

#Lower case the string:
txt = "HELLO FRIENDS"

x = txt.lower()

print(x)

#Remove spaces to the left of the string:
txt = "     banana     "

x = txt.lstrip()

print("of all fruits",x,"is my favorite")

#Create a mapping table, and use it in the translate() method to replace any "S" characters with a "P" character:
txt = "Hello Sam!";
mytable = txt.maketrans("Sam", "Paa");
print(txt.translate(mytable));

#Partitions
txt = "I could eat bananas all day"

x = txt.partition("bananas")

print(x)

#Replace the word "bananas":
txt = "I like bananas"

x = txt.replace("bananas", "chocolat")

print(x)

#Where in the text is the last occurrence of the string "casa"?:
txt = "Mi casa, su casa."

x = txt.rfind("casa")

print(x)

#Where in the text is the last occurrence of the string "casa"?:
txt = "banana"

x = txt.rjust(20)

print(x, "is my favorite fruit.")

#rpartition
'''
Search for the last occurrence of the word "bananas", and return a tuple with three elements:

1 - everything before the "match"
2 - the "match"
3 - everything after the "match"
'''
txt = "I could eat bananas all day, bananas are my favorite fruit!"

x = txt.rpartition("bananas")

print(x)

#rsplit: Split a string into a list, using comma, followed by a space (, ) as the separator:
txt = "apple, banana, cherry"

# setting the maxsplit parameter to 1, will return a list with 2 elements!
x = txt.rsplit(", ", 1)

print(x)

#Remove any white spaces at the end of the string:
txt = "     banana     "

x = txt.rstrip()

print("of all fruits", x, "is my favorite")
